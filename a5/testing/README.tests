Test Documentation
===========================================================================

# File Organization

All test cases are placed within the pass folder
README file is `testing/README.tests`.
A special test case for the "get" operation - tic-tac-toe!

# Test cases

Given that we have a framework which will transform 488 code into 
C++ code and subsequently compiled into binary executable, we can
compare the output of the binary vs. the output generated by the
488 machine code. Test case passes when all outputs are equivalent,
and fails when there are any mismatch between the outputs.

The full test-suite can be invoked with the following command:

./test-suite.sh

This assumes you are in the root folder of this project. In order
to run the test suite, g++ version 4.7 or greater is *required*.

To test a single file use:

java -jar dist/compiler488.jar -i testing/pass/E.488 -cpp --validate

To see output without validation, use:

java -jar dist/compiler488.jar -i testing/pass/E.488 -ll normal

The above command will work without g++ 4.7.

# Tic-Tac-Toe

Since our framework does not work when user input is required, a
special test case not inside the pass folder, but just inside the
testing folder exists to test user input. It allows the user to 
play a two human player tic-tac-toe game.

You can play it by entering the following command:

java -jar dist/compiler488.jar -i testing/tictactoe.488 -ll normal
