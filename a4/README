The code generation templates describe our plan to translate 488 code into
machine code for the course pseudo machine. The assignment is organized
into five parts representing groups of language features and each of those
parts are described in a separate document in this submission. Those
documents are:

1. templateStorage.txt - Storage and Addressing of Variables and Constants
2. templateExpressions.txt - Expressions
3. templateRoutines.txt - Functions and Procedures
4. templateStatements.txt - Statements
5. templateOther.txt - Other

Each document first describes the high level plan for mapping the language,
then give specific examples of how particular code snippets might be
translated.
